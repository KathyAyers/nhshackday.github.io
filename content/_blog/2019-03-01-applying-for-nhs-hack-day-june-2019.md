If you're new to NHS Hack Day (and even if you're not), the thought of pitching your idea to an entire room of people is quite daunting.

## What is a pitch?

A pitch is a short opportunity for a person to share a project idea to tempt others to work on it with them.

At the start of NHS Hack Day, anyone with a problem or project they think might be interesting to other attendees can speak for up to 60 seconds to explain it to the rest of the group.

Based on these short pitches, other attendees decide what they’d like to spend time on on during the weekend.

The pitches are short, and so it is not possible to use slides or to show demos on the projector. This is almost always a good thing -- you can focus on making your explanation as clear to as many people as possible.

If you really need to show something (seriously, you probably don't), you could hold up a sheet of flipchart paper (we’ll have lots of this) -- but try not to over-complicate or over-think it :
