summary: "Our application allows users to manage training to use intensive care unit\
  \ equipment, which is currently hard to record and manage for team leaders. The\
  \ application brings together staff, role, equipment and training information all\
  \ in one place for leaders to make timely, informed decisions on the training needs\
  \ of their staff to meet patient needs."
