To celebrate **five years of NHS Hack Day**, we're adding an extra event to
our calendar - as well as Spring, Autumn and Winter events, we're excited to announce
**NHS Hack Day Manchester**, taking place **July 15-16**.

As well as all the usual NHS Hack Day activities, we're trying something new.

Together with some of our friends from
[Digital Health Networks](https://discourse.digitalhealth.net)
we're going to be curating a short list of potential projects that we will publish
ahead of the event as our NHS Hack Day **Summer Challenges**.

These challenges will be problems that we think are particularly important for the
NHS to address, focussing on **areas of particular pain for patients and clinicians**.

We'll be doing a few extra things to make sure these challenges have the best chance
of turning into projects that have a real impact beyond the event itself.

We'll be making sure that they're explained well, publically before the event. Expect
us to provide you with clear articulations of the problem, user stories, personas of
the types of user involved. We'll also point towards relevant open standards and APIs
that teams should make sure
that any project is at least theoretically capable of interacting with, as well as
any important background domain knowledge about the context of the messy real world of
the NHS.

For these challenges we'll also be trying to help bridge the gap between projects at
the event, and actually getting those projects into use at NHS organisations. We'll be
making sure that we have **NHS champions** for each of them, who will take the best projects
back to the places where they work, and use them to help make the case for their
organisations to actually do the hard work to try and address these problems.

## What can I do to help?

For now we're looking for submissions that will outline potential projects that could become
one of our Summer Challenges. We'll be collecting these **until April 21st**, and then
announcing them on **June 1st**.

So - if you have a great idea that you would like to see become one of our challenges, let
us know in the form below:
